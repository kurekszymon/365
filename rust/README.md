# rust

## why

since there is no single correct way to learn cpp properly, and everyone is writing cpp in their own dialect.
I wanted to try some functional-style language for some time now, I decided to give rust a try, especially because of the book, and Zed being written in rust

## project

- get familiar with rust fundamentals with [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- write my own code editor (crazy idea probably)
  - global search with regex
  - command palette (`> Format document` + custom commands)
  - file palette (open any file with cmd p, jump to line `:42`)

## 14.02

- get started with the book
